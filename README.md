### ðŸŒ± Best Wishes to the Coding Efforts as to Brain Science
Hello! I am Xuanzhi Chen (é™ˆç‚«å¿— in Chinese) ðŸ‘‹

My strong passions lie in the spectrum of brain science: e.g. neurotechnology, neuroscience, and neuroAI.

Currently, I am a senior student seeking for the MS or PhD brain science programs in fall, 2025.
I will receive a BS in computer science this summer from GDUT (Guangdong University of Technology, China),
where I have experienced a research internship at the DMIR lab (Data Mining and Information Retrieval Laboratory)
working with [Prof. Ruichu Cai](https://ruichucai.github.io/).
DMIR lab has been collaboratively developing [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) (Python package for causal discovery) by CMU.

#### âš¡ Coding Ideas
I intend to work for programming that
can better process and analyze the tremendous volume of (brain) data,
contributing my modest efforts to the current-and-future thriving communities of (brain) science.

For my potential future research and long-term work, I wish my coding ideation might involve:
* Building targeted computational platforms for processing variant types of brain data; 
* Providing APIs of brain data analysis that encapsulate mathematical and statistical approaches;  
* Assisting intelligent agents in cultivating the insight corresponding to the moral of neural cognition.
