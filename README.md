### 🌱 Best Wishes to the Coding Efforts as for Brain Science, Causation, and NeuroAI
Hello! I am Xuanzhi Chen (陈炫志 in Chinese) 👋

I am a senior student seeking for the MS or PhD programs in brain science.
I will receive a BS in computer science this summer from GDUT (Guangdong University of Technology)
where I have experienced a research internship at the Data Mining and Information Retrieval Laboratory ([@DMIR lab](https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group)) 
working with [Prof. Ruichu Cai](https://ruichucai.github.io/).
DMIR lab has been collaboratively developing the python package [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) by CMU for causal discovery.

#### ⚡ Coding Ideas
I intend to work for programming that
can better process and analyze the tremendous volume of (brain) data,
making my modest efforts to the current-and-future thriving communities of (brain) science.

> “通过代码程序更好地 ‘理解’（脑电）数据是我的编程理念所在, 希望为当下乃至未来的（脑）科学社区贡献绵薄之力。”

For my future research and work, my potential interest might lie in:
* Building targeted computational platforms for researchers to deal with brain data such as EEG data and fMRI data; 
* Providing easy-to-use APIs which encapsulate mathematical and statistical approaches for brain analysis;
* Assisting intelligent agents in discovering specific patterns from raw data corresponding to the moral of neural cognition.
