### 🌱 Best Wishes to the Coding Efforts as for Brain Science, Causation, and NeuroAI
Hello! I am Xuanzhi Chen (陈炫志 in Chinese) 👋

I am a senior student seeking for the MS or PhD programs in brain science.
I will receive a BS in computer science this summer from GDUT (Guangdong University of Technology)
where I have experienced a research internship at the Data Mining and Information Retrieval Laboratory ([@DMIR lab](https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group)) 
working with [Prof. Ruichu Cai](https://ruichucai.github.io/).
DMIR lab has been collaboratively developing the python package [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) by CMU for causal discovery.

#### ⚡ Coding Ideas
I intend to work for programming that
can better process and analyze the tremendous volume of (brain) data,
making my modest efforts to the current-and-future thriving communities of brain science.
For my future research and work, my potential interest might lie in:
* Building computational platforms on targeted purpose for brain researchers to deal with brain data such as EEG data and fMRI data; 
* Providing easy-to-use APIs which encapsulate mathematical and statistical approaches for brain analysis;
* Assisting intelligent agents in discovering specific patterns from raw data corresponding to the moral of brain cognition.
