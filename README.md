### HelloðŸ‘‹ I am Xuanzhi CHEN (or é™ˆç‚«å¿— in Chinese) 
See more info at my personal website: [xuanzhi's homepage](https://xuanzhichen.github.io)

#### ðŸ”­ Intro
I am an undergraduate student who is currently seeking to engage in a 2025-fall Master graduate program relating to General Computer Science.

#### ðŸŒ± Coding Interest
In the intersection of computer science and applied math (applied statistics), my interest involves a couple of topics: **machine intelligence**, **computational data analysis**, and **information technology**. My envision at its best â€” engineering computational and mathematical solutions to address industrial problems (e.g. in relation of **commercial and financial** areas) motivates me to hone skills in programming, focusing on design of learning-algorithms, utility of available data, and/or efficacy of digital systems.

#### âš¡ Coding Experience (promotion)
- The *DMIR* lab (Data Mining and Information Retrieval) at *GDUT* (China) has collaboratively developed the Python package [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) (Tetrad Program) initiated by *CMU*, which provides **implementations of out-of-the-box causal discovery algorithms**.
- I created [CADIMULC](https://github.com/xuanzhichen/cadimulc?tab=readme-ov-file) during my research internship working at the *DMIR* lab, offering **implementations of causal-inspired algorithms proposed by the *DMIR* lab** ([IEEE TNNLS, 2021](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Causal+discovery+in+linear+non-gaussian+acyclic+model+with+multiple+latent+confounders&btnG=#)), along with [an instructive demo](https://xuanzhichen.github.io/cadimulc/) to help beginners interested in causal science get **a quick grasp as to the ins and outs of Causal Discovery** (e.g. how to generate data / apply causal inference / evaluate results).
