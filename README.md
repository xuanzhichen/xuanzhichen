### ðŸŒ± Best Wishes to the Coding Efforts as to Brain Science
Hello! I am Xuanzhi Chen (é™ˆç‚«å¿— in Chinese) ðŸ‘‹

See more at my personal website: [xuanzhi's homepage](https://xuanzhichen.github.io)

#### ðŸ”­ Intro
In the spectrum of brain science, my strong interest and passions involve Neurotechnology (e.g. brain-computer-interface, brain-controlled robotics) and Neuroscience (e.g. computational cognitive neuroscien, neuroAI).

Currently, I am an undergraduate student who are seeking for engaging a MS or PhD program as to neuroscience in fall, 2025.
I received a BS in computer science this summer from GDUT (Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China),
where I have experienced two-year a research internship at the DMIR lab (Data Mining and Information Retrieval Laboratory)
that focus on the interface between Causal Inference and AI.

The DMIR lab has been collaboratively developing the Python package [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) initiated by CMU, 
which provides implementations of out-of-the-box causal discovery algorithms.

#### âš¡ Coding Ideas
I wish to work for the programming that advances the ways about how we process, analyze, and leverage tremendous volumes of data or signals given by our brains,
contributing my modest efforts to the current-and-future thriving communities of brain science.

For future research and long-term career, my coding ideation might have involved:
* Building integrated computational platforms (framework) for processing variant types of brain data or signals; 
* Providing the APIs applied to data or signals that encapsulate AI-propelled and mathematical-based approaches for brain analysis;  
* Strengthening controllable intelligent-agents and effective human-machine interactions.
