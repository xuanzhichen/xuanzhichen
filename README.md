### ðŸŒ± Best Wishes to the Coding Efforts as for Brain Science, Causation, and NeuroAI
Hello! I am Xuanzhi Chen (é™ˆç‚«å¿— in Chinese) ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior student seeking for the MS or PhD programs in brain science.
I will receive a BS in computer science this summer from GDUT (Guangdong University of Technology)
where I have experienced a research internship at the Data Mining and Information Retrieval Laboratory ([@DMIR lab](https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group)) 
working with [Prof. Ruichu Cai](https://ruichucai.github.io/).
DMIR lab has been collaboratively developing the python package [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) by CMU for causal discovery.
